Welcome to Let's Eat All Food: Get Obese or (LEAFGO)

How to Get Obese:
    1. We are using a Pixel 2 API 28 Emulator in Android Studio.
    2. Using Android Studio (or IntelliJ), clone this repository and build the project.
    3. Build and run the app.
    4. On the Android Emulator, change your current location to simulate your current location.
    5. When at an unvisited restaurant, (blue pins) hit the GO button to simulate a visit and the pin will turn red.
        a. May not function on first click. Click GO maybe twice or more. Work in progress.
    6. You have visited this restaurant, enjoy your food!

The goal of this project is to help you track restaurants you have visited in your area to encourage a variety in your culinary
endeavors. The end goal is to visit them all.
